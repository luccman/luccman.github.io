        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In <strong>"Hunted Hunter,"</strong> players immerse themselves in a 2D platformer set within a dense forest. As the protagonist, players must navigate through the wilderness while contending with various challenges. Among these challenges are aggressive wolves that leap to attack and eagles that descend from the sky. To survive, players can strategically deploy kunai to eliminate threats. Additionally, players can utilize environmental elements such as rocks for defense against wolves and trees for cover from eagle assaults. To add to the strategic depth, players must manage their resources wisely, as kunai are limited in supply and gradually replenish over time.</p>
